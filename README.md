# Zorya
Zorya implements a concolic execution methodology to find vulnerabilities in application binaries. It uses Ghidra's Pcode to handle most of languages, including Go lang.

## Install
Make sure to have Rust, Golang and Python properly installed.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/kajaaz/zorya.git
cd zorya
make setup
make install
```


## Usage
To use Zorya, you will need the absolute path to the binary you want to analyze ```path```, and the hexadecimal address where to start the execution ```addr```:
```
zorya <path> <addr>
```

## Deep dive inside

### Architecture
- Implement a concolic execution engine (concrete and symbolic) written in Rust,
- Uses Ghidraâ€™s P-Code as Intermediate Representation (IR),
- Has an internal structure based on an AMD64 CPU and a virtual file system.

### Internal Structure
- Implement concolically most of the P-Code opcodes (see ```executor_[int|float|bool].rs```),
- Implement concolically common syscalls and CPU instructions (see ```executor_callother.rs``` and ```executor_callother_syscalls.rs```),
- Has an integrated handling of the generation and parsing of P-Code (see ```pcode-generator``` and ```pcode-parser```),
- Has a mechanism to get and set the value of AMD64 registers and sub-registers - i.e. for instance, get only the specific bytes of a full register (see ```cpu_state.rs```).

### Functionnalities
- Can generate a file with the detailed logs of the execution of each instruction (see ```execution_log.txt```),
- Can generate a file with the names of the executed functions (see ```execution_trace.txt```),
- Can analyse the concolic handling of the jump tables, a specific type of switch tables that replace binary search by more efficient jumping mechanism for close number labels (see ```jump_table.json```),
- Can generate a file witht the cross-reference addresses leading to all the panic functions that are in the target binary (see ```xref_addresses.txt```),
- Is able to translate the executable part of libc.so and ld-linux-x86-64.so as P-Code after its dynamic loading.

### Invariants writing
- Has integrated Z3 capabilities for writing invariants over the instructions and CPU registers, through the Rust crate.

## Troubleshooting
When building the project, if you have issues related to C++, it might be necessary to also specify the path to ```libclang.so```:
```
sudo locate libclang.so
export LIBCLANG_PATH=/path/to/lib/libclang.so
```
